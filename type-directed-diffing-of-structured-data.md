[_Type-Directed Diffing of Structured Data_](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/publications/2017-tyde-draft-2.pdf), Victor Cacciari Miraldo, Pierre-Évariste Dagand, Wouter Swierstra. A datatype-generic representation for tree diffs, motivated specifically by syntax tree diffing. The authors note the mismatch between the notion of a _minimal _tree diff and a _usable _tree diff, in human terms, and thus discuss tree _alignments _rather than _edits_. Further, they make use of nondeterminism to produce the set of possible alignments rather than selecting a single one \(since they haven’t yet formalized a metric for usability that would guide a decision procedure\). This work was done in parallel to our own, but is an interesting point of comparison and inspiration going forwards. It’s also comforting that the authors echoed our experience: this problem is _hard_. Wouter Swierstra also suggested that they’d be interested in comparing notes with us at some point.
