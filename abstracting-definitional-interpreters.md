[_Abstracting Definitional Interpreters_](https://plum-umd.github.io/abstracting-definitional-interpreters/), David Darais, Nicholas Labich, Phúc C. Nguyễn, David Van Horn. A beautiful, compositional, extensible framework for code analysis depending on a case-wise interpreter for a given language. In addition to the analyses defined in the paper, it makes excellent scaffolding for experimenting with new analyses. For example, the[`abstract-interpretation`](https://github.com/robrix/abstract-interpretation)package extends the paper’s abstraction of primitives into a Hindley-Milner type-checker. We intend to integrate this into`semantic-diff`in support of a variety of analytical features from type-checking to bounds-checking to complexity approximation—and diffing thereof.
