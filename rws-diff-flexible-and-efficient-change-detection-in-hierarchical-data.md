[_RWS-Diff: Flexible and Efficient Change Detection in Hierarchical Data_](https://db.in.tum.de/~finis/papers/RWS-Diff.pdf), Jan Finis, Martin Raiber, Nikolaus Augsten, Robert Brunel, Alfons Kemper, Franz Färber. Presents an O\(_n_log_n_\) approximation to the minimal tree edit sequence problem \(tree diffing\) which relies on hashing, random number generators, large-dimensional feature vectors, and techniques originating in computer vision to compare them. Note that there are some substantial costs glossed over in the paper, e.g. large constant factors & an out-of-band pre-pass matching up identical subtrees. Additionally, our observation has been that it produces higher-quality results on large subtrees than it does on small ones \(where the “noise” introduced by hashing & the RNG dominates the similarity of short paths\).
